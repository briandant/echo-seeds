Migrating Data From Old Systems
=================================

Initial Seed Data 
------------------- 

The first migration, in the module ``utils.importers.seed_data.py``, has a few functions to import data.

The ``initial-seed-data.csv`` came from the system that was in use at ECHO in 
May of 2013 (name?). The file came from Seth, and Brian (briandant414@gmail.com)
has the original spreadsheet stored `on Google Drive_`.
